<p>I get asked all the time what I think of BitCon&#x2026;this guy says it better than I could.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>+1 for linking to something by Alex Payne. I love him.</p>
<p>About the actual content, at one point Alex says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#x2019;re told that Bitcoin &#x201C;fixes serious problems with existing payment systems that depend on centralized services to verify the validity of transactions.&#x201D; If by &#x201C;fixes&#x201D; you mean &#x201C;ignores&#x201D;, then yes: a Bitcoin transaction, like cash, comes with the certainty that a definite quantity of a store of value has changed hands, and little else. How this verifies any &#x201C;validity&#x201D; or cuts down on fraud I&#x2019;m not sure; stolen Bitcoins are spent as easily as stolen cash, which is why <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/20/more-bitcoins-more-problems-how-hackers-are-targeting-bitcoins.html">theft of Bitcoins has been rampant</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the concern isn&#x2019;t with fraud or validity. The problem that Bitcoin solves is with the centralized banking model. The fundamental idea behind Bitcoin is that it cannot be centrally controlled or taken down, like the internet. It is impossible to flip a switch and &#x201C;turn off&#x201D; the Bitcoin network. It <em>is</em> possible to do that with a centralized bank: in that case, &#x201C;flipping the switch&#x201D; ends up being &#x201C;shut down the bank&#x201D;. Or, &#x201C;drive the bank out of business&#x201D;.</p>
<pre><code>If Bitcoin&#x2019;s strength comes from decentralization, why pour millions into a single company? Ah, because Coinbase provides an &#x201C;accessible interface to the Bitcoin protocol&#x201D;, we&#x2019;re told. We must centralize to decentralize, you see; such is the perverse logic of capital co-opting power. In order for Bitcoin to grow a thriving ecosystem, it apparently needs a US-based, VC-backed company that has &#x201C;worked closely with banks and regulators to ensure that the service is safe and compliant&#x201D;.
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe the problem isn&#x2019;t with Bitcoin itself, but with what Coinbase is doing with the Bitcoin protocol. Now, to be clear, I think the Bitcoin to USD bridge aspect of Coinbase is OK. But I think that this paragraph is very, very true: it is <em>perverse</em> that we have centralized a decentralized protocol. Decentralized protocols tend to be very dangerous, IMHO, because of the tendency of users to just go with the most popular provider because it&#x2019;s the easiest solution, and then effectively centralizing the network in the process.</p>
<p>Anyone remember XMPP? XMPP was supposed to be great. It was supposed to be the future of communications on the internet. But in practice, XMPP servers are unreliable. It&#x2019;s hard to find one that works well. I don&#x2019;t actually use XMPP a lot myself, but there are a lot of problems with connections, chat requests being undone (so you have to add a contact for a second time), etc. So what happened because of these problems (and the fact that everyone uses Gmail)? The most-used XMPP server is talk.google.com. At least it was, until Google replaced Google Talk with Google Hangouts, which uses a proprietary protocol with no XMPP bridge - and so the network got screwed over, because suddenly, a lot of people upgraded to Hangouts and cut themselves off from the XMPP network. The sad truth, though, is that it almost doesn&#x2019;t matter. Take a survey of any random Google Talk user. I will bet you $100 that less than 1 out of 50 people who you talk to won&#x2019;t know that Google Talk is based on XMPP, much less what XMPP is. And there&#x2019;s almost zero chance that they understand why XMPP matters, or why federated protocols and networks matter.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m getting off track, though. So back to Bitcoin and Coinbase. I think what Coinbase is doing by hosting people&#x2019;s Bitcoin wallets and transactions is fundamentally <em>wrong</em>, because I truly believe that it damages the Bitcoin ecosystem. The centralization in Coinbase is, IMHO, a major problem.</p>
<p>I wonder if this will be solved with a project like <a href="https://arkos.io/">arkOS</a>. I mean, maybe the solutionv that will ultimately happen is for people to spin up their own instances of a Coinbase-like Bitcoin wallet. I think it&#x2019;s pretty clear that people, in general, like cloud apps better than desktop apps. Access from any computer is a really nice feature to have. Maybe projects like arkOS will help decentralized protocols like Bitcoin remain decentralized in practice.</p>
<p>Or maybe Bitcoin will effectively die, just like XMPP did. I mean, sure, XMPP is still a network. But no one really uses it consciously. Almost everyone who uses XMPP nowadays does so accidentally, through a service that just happens to have an XMPP bridge. Google Talk was a prime example of this, but it&#x2019;s dead. Now, I&#x2019;ll bet money that the most-used XMPP provider is Facebook. Never knew that Facebook Chat had an XMPP bridge? That&#x2019;s because Facebook doesn&#x2019;t advertise it; the only time it&#x2019;s mentioned is in the developer docs. The mainstream does not care about the XMPP protocol, because we centralized it. What the mainstream <em>does</em> care about is the services that we centralized it on: Google and Facebook. And that&#x2019;s a real problem.</p>

            <h2 class="p-name">Programming as an art form</h2></a>
          <p class="post-metadata">Published by <a href="https://strugee.net/" rel="author" class="p-author h-card">Alex Jordan</a> and categorized as <a href="/blog/category/development/">development</a> and <a href="/blog/category/musings/">musings</a>
          </p>
          <div class="e-content"><p>The other day I described programming to someone. I pointed out that it&#x27;s actually pretty easy to teach yourself programming languages, especially since after a while you start to carry over concepts from other languages. But what surprised me most about <em>my own explanation</em>(!) was when I compared programming to art: it&#x27;s the kind of thing where you can just try stuff out and see what works and what doesn&#x27;t, with no real consequences.</p>
<p>Since I said that, I&#x27;ve actually been thinking about it quite a bit. Programming is traditionally described as an activity closely related to mathematics, and to a certain extent, this makes a lot of sense, because of the logical skills that go into programming. You have to be able to reason your way through situations in order to effectively debug a program, which means logically eliminating possible points of failure. This is where math skills become very important.</p>
<p>But coding isn&#x27;t just about logic. At <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">OSBRIDGE</a> this year, I attended a session about the beauty of code - it&#x27;s hard to describe to someone who doesn&#x27;t live and breathe code, but we all know it when we see it. We as a community value elegance in code; clever algorithms; thinking outside the box, and as I said in my <a href="https://strugee.net/presentation-just-do-it/#19">Just Do It slides</a>, the mere existance of Ruby proves this. So when I described programming as being like art, part of where I was getting that is the analogy I actually said (being able to easily mess around), but part of it was coming from my appreciation of the beauty of code. Part of it was coming from my sense of the aesthetic properties of programming.</p>
<p>I want us, as a community, in both our regular coding but also our educational outreach, to stop pretending that programming is so logical that it <em>is</em> math. Yes, there are elements of mathematics in coding. Lots of it, even. But to treat programming as a branch of mathematics is doing a disservice to the practice. So in addition to treating programming as a form of math, I want us to start treating programming as a form of art. There <em>is</em> such a thing as ugly code. The entire concept of refactoring would barely exist if that wasn&#x27;t true. So let&#x27;s start truly appreciating the aesthetic beauty of code, and let&#x27;s start teaching that. To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure how you would teach that. But it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.</p>
<p>But even if we can and should treat it as both of those things, that doesn&#x27;t mean that we should make that the be-all-end-all of how we describe programming. I truly believe that programming is not a branch of mathematics. And it&#x27;s not an art form, either. Programming is neither of those things and both of those things; it is something entirely new, and we should treat it as such. If this isn&#x27;t true, why do people swear by certain software? Why do people (including myself) aggressively sticker their laptops to showcase what software they use? And if this isn&#x27;t true, how is it possible that people <em>love</em> their code?</p>
