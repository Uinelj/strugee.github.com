		h2.talk-title Just Do It: The Approachability of Free Software for Beginners
		blockquote.talk-description
			p We all know that one of free software's greatest strengths is the ability to do whatever you're interested in, without asking for permission. But even though we all know, we don't talk about it that much, and in particular, we don't talk about the significance of what that strength means for those who are just beginning their programming careers.
			p "Just Do It - The Approachability of Free Software for Beginners" will put forth the idea that the #[em only] tools that are approachable for beginners while still leading to the ability to produce what we would call "high quality" software are all free software tools. It will talk about the ability of free and open source software to inspire curiosity and interest and the role of that curiosity in bringing new programmers into our community. Finally, it will explore some of the areas that this model fails in, and what we can do to fix it.

		h2.talk-title Pump.io + Community = â™¥
		blockquote.talk-description
			p Pump.io is a promising project to create a federated social network. It was abandoned for a while, but its maintainer has recently started transferring governance and code maintenance to the community. Come to this talk to learn details about what Pump.io is, why it's awesome, and the future plans for it.
			p This was originally a lightning talk dealing mostly with the community, but was expanded to a full session. The extra time was used to talk a little about the history of where pump.io comes from and its API.
