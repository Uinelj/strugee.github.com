# Post text

RSS and pagination are now enabled on strugee.net's blog, thanks to [stratic-indexes-to-rss][] and [stratic-paginate-indexes][] respectively.

The pagination code is already pretty solid although there's always room for [improvement][] - thanks to [Ajay Tungare][] for pairing with me at the [Recurse Center][] and helping me catch the bug! However, I'm not particularly confident in the RSS code, since RSS is actually somewhat tricky to properly handle. Because of that, I would seriously appreciate it if people tried adding the RSS feeds to their readers and seeing if anything breaks. If so, [let me know][]!

Cheers!
