For a while now I've been avoiding using the term "free software."

Why? It's just plain confusing to people. I know Richard Stallman will tell you that it means freedom, not gratis. _It doesn't matter_. It's still ambiguous and needlessly conflates two different concepts.

Instead of "free software," I propose "freedom-respecting software" as a replacement. This phrasing is not only unambigous, it also does a much more effective job of communicating the general meaning of the term without further explanation. (Of course you'll probably still need to explain it, but you'll have to spend a lot less time doing so.) The one problem with this phrasing is that it's longer, but even that doesn't hold water - because of the aformentioned problems with "free software," people actually don't say "free software" all that much; instead, they say "free (as in freedom) software" which is unambiguous, but awkward on multiple levels. Not only is it a less eloquent way of describing the concept, but gramatically speaking it's really terrible as it puts a parenthetical qualifier in-between an adjective and a noun, which just sounds _terrible_ and unnatural. Seriously, say both of them out loud. "Freedom-respecting software" and "free (as in freedom) software" - which one sounds like less of a mouthful?

Hence, I think "free software" as a term should be considered harmful, and replaced with "freedom-respecting software" instead.
