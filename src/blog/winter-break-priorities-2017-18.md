So I just wanted to write something up real fast to document my development priorities over my upcoming winter break (which starts tomorrow, whoohoo!). This is just generally useful to have, because I'm forgetful, but will also help keep me accountable since the list is public.

So, here are the projects I want to get done, in rough order of priority:

1. Polish up an [outstanding Node.js Pull Request][nodepr] that automatically generates manpages for every module shipped with Node core
2. Deal with GPG key signing which I have been procrasinating on for, well, years now
3. Push some Debian packaging work forward (I've done some work to get the [Profanity packaging][] up-to-date, and I want to get [filter-other-days][] into Debian as well)
4. Finish up v1 of [lazymention] - high-priority since it's so close to being done!
5. Finally push through and implement [ActivityPub in pump.io core][ap]
6. Clear [the backlog of PRs][backlog] sent to pump.io

I also am setting a goal of writing at least two blog posts per week.

That seems like a lot, honestly, and yet I feel like I must have missed something - I will update this list if I think of anything else!

Cheers, and happy holidays everyone! \o/
