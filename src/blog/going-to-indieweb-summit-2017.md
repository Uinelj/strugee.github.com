I'll be <data class="p-rsvp" value="yes">attending</data> the <a href="https://2017.indieweb.org/" class="u-in-reply-to">IndieWeb Summit</a> this year (well, the first day). Hopefully I'll write a way to actually post notes and RSVPs properly on this site, instead of sketchily writing the HTML by hand, which is what I did for this RSVP.
