Once again I need to test whether [lazymention][] - and more importantly, the underlying libraries ([node-send-webmention][] and [node-get-webmention-url][]) - complies with the [W3C spec][]. I'll be using [webmention.rocks][], so, here's a large list of links:

[Test 1](https://webmention.rocks/test/1), [Test 2](https://webmention.rocks/test/2), [Test 3](https://webmention.rocks/test/3), [Test 4](https://webmention.rocks/test/4), [Test 5](https://webmention.rocks/test/5), [Test 6](https://webmention.rocks/test/6), [Test 7](https://webmention.rocks/test/7), [Test 8](https://webmention.rocks/test/8), [Test 9](https://webmention.rocks/test/9), [Test 10](https://webmention.rocks/test/10), [Test 11](https://webmention.rocks/test/11), [Test 12](https://webmention.rocks/test/12), [Test 13](https://webmention.rocks/test/13), [Test 14](https://webmention.rocks/test/14), [Test 15](https://webmention.rocks/test/15), [Test 16](https://webmention.rocks/test/16), [Test 17](https://webmention.rocks/test/17), [Test 18](https://webmention.rocks/test/18), [Test 19](https://webmention.rocks/test/19), [Test 20](https://webmention.rocks/test/20), [Test 21](https://webmention.rocks/test/21), [Test 22](https://webmention.rocks/test/22), [Test 23](https://webmention.rocks/test/23/page)

Hopefully it works \o/
