## Day 23

Arrived ~10:00, departed ~21:45, total time at RC 11h45m.

Didn't get a whole lot done today, mostly because we were all welcoming the Spring 1s - I went out to lunch with some of them and participated in Code Dojo in the afternoon ([Aditya][] and I solved the challenge in `bash`, which was pretty interesting an also hilarious\[1]). However, I did do some maintenance on [gplenforced.org][]. I did, however, start a project to display activity in 455 Broadway in realtime which I'm pretty exited about.

 \[1]: Aditya asked me "so can you just cast a string to an integer in `bash` or...?" and when I said no he looked at me and asked how in the world we could complete this task - not realizing that the correct question is, of course, "does `bash` have a type system?" The answer to which is no, no it does not.

## Day 24

Arrived ~14:30, departed ~1:10, total time at RC 10h40m.

Spent most of today working on realtime.recurse.com - I got the basic API working, so you can POST to the server and it'll handle expiry properly. Also spent a lot of time blogging for the Iron Blogger meeting (in which I got sentenced to use `vim` for the week instead of Emacs for not writing a post a couple weeks ago).

## Day 25

Arrived ~10:30, departed ~19:10, total time at RC 8h40m.

Spent the day catching up on various things, notably putting out a new pump.io beta that backported some regression fixes. In the evening I spent most of my time finishing up a mid-year college application form before videocalling with a friend in college.

## Day 26

Arrived ~10:35, departed ~1:05, total time at RC 14h30m.

Spent some time working on server stuff today. Other than that though I didn't do much of anything.

## Friday

Arrived ~16:20, departed ~1:45, total time at RC 9h25m. As always, Friday doesn't count as a day because RC is technically not in session.

Worked on [generator-stratic][] today. I fixed some bugs and disabled some functionality that wasn't complete (and was non-trivial to complete). Published a beta 0 in the evening.

## Executive summary

This week was... _okay_ in terms of productivity. It started off relatively good, slipped a fair amount in the middle, and then somewhat came back at the end of the week. I did, however, check off some semi-longstanding issues on my todo list. So that's nice.

Total time at RC 55 hours 0 minutes; cumulative time 294 hours 25 minutes.
