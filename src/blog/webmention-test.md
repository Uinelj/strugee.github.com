# Post text

This post exists only to have a dedicated test URL to send example webmentions to until [webmention.io issue 77][1] is fixed (or in other words, I need a URL with a wide variety of webmention data associated with it so I can test the webmention styling you see at the bottom of all individual post pages).

It will be removed eventually, probably.
