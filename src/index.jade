		h2#hi Hi!
		p	Heyo, I'm Alex Jordan, also known as AJ. I'm 17, live in Washington, and cofounded <a href="http://nightlightweb.github.io">Nightlight Web</a> with my buddy <a href="http://jacksondc.com">Jackson</a>. Love that guy.

		h2#interesting Q: Shut up about yourself, do you have anything interesting to show me?
		p A: Yes! Take a look at the <a href="projects">projects</a> page.
		p	Note: this section is specifically aimed towards those of you who will think about accusing me of not having real content, and will make a remark about <a href="http://catb.org/esr/html-hell.html">retiring to Aruba tomorrow with a bevy of supermodels</a>.

		h2#passions Passions of mine
		p I freaking love code. I'm actually really good at theoretical programming (a term I have made up for this page), meaning I just know a ton of random useful stuff, mostly from Wikipedia, FreeDesktop, and the GNOME Wiki. Like, I know about GObject Introspection, and ioctl()s, and the difference between the W3C and the WHATWG, and why you should use git, and a bunch of other things ranging from pretty dang useful to semi-useful all the way down to fascinating and useless. I'm not extremely good at practical code-writing, but I'm working on it.
		p On this page, I used to say that I'm a passionate Mozillian. I still consider myself a Mozillian, and occasionally flit into SUMO and Live Chat and help people, but I'm more interested in other things now, primarily GNU, operating system design (for example, <a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/">Plan 9 from Bell Labs</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_kernel">Mach kernel</a>), and system administration.
		p I'm a vocal supporter of digital freedom. I'm strongly opposed to things like SOPA, DRM, and Restricted Boot. I'm also a proud GNU, *nix, and free and libre software heretic.

		h2#learn Stuff I want to learn
		p Like I said, I love code. So here's an incomplete, unorganized list of technologies that I want to learn:
			ul
				li C
				li Plan 9-style C
				li Limbo
				li Vala and associated technologies (GObject, mostly)
				li GTK+
				li Common Lisp
				li Racket
				li Haskell
				li Brainfuck
				li Perl
				li Smalltalk
		
		p ...and also some technologies that I'm <em>vaguely</em> interested in learning:
			ul
				li Swift
				li x86 assembler
				li Scheme
				li PHP - basically only so I can contribute to existing projects using it. Otherwise I'm completely uninterested.

		p ...and also some technologies that I've learned to varying degrees but want to learn more of:
		p
			ul
				li HTML/CSS/JavaScript - I know these fairly well, but I could improve. (Also, as an aside, this site is deliberately bare-bones, because I like that style and not because I can't do better.)
				li bash
				li POSIX sh
				li node.js - in particular, I would like to get better at the streams API.
				li make
				li Java, mostly for Android development
				li C++
				li Python
				li DebHelper
				li RobotC
				li ELisp

		h2#steevie steevie
		p I run a server called steevie. steevie is supposed to be a traditional UNIX server, which isn't really relevant anymore - now that you can run Xorg on a laptop without swapping - but still fun. He has a longish history of installations, but he currently runs Debian Wheezy.
