				In order to use any of these services, you will need to authenticate either with a BrowserID account or a local Ubuntu account, depending on the type of service.

				<h2><a href="http://emergence.alexj.jumpingcrab.com">Emergence Story Project</a></h2>
				<p>
					The Emergence Story Project requires a modern browser (Firefox and Chrome are the best) and a BrowserID account. You can also look at an exact <a href="emergence_requirements.html">list of browser requirements</a> if you want.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Emergence Story Project is currently in an incomplete form and is not functional. When it is done, it will run a check to make sure that your browser has the necessary capabilities to run it. If your browser is not supported, you will have to upgrade it - the Story Project depends on modern HTML5 features like WebSockets in order to run. For advanced users, the Story Project will provide a list of test faliures so that you can see exactly where your browser falls short.

			<div class="serviceblock" id="ssh">
				<h2><a href="ssh://alexj.jumpingcrab.com">SSH</a></h2>
				<p>
					SSH requires a command-line shell (such as <code>bash</code>), an SSH client (like <code>ssh</code>), and an account on the local Ubuntu system (to request an account, <a href="mailto: alexander3223098@gmail.com">email me</a>).
				</p>
				<p>
					In case this link doesn't work, you can connect to <code>alexj.jumpingcrab.com</code>, usually by running the command <code>ssh [username]@alexj.jumpingcrab.com</code> in a terminal, replacing <code>[username]</code> with your username.
				</p>

			<div class="serviceblock" id="ftp">
				<h2><a href="ftp://alexj.jumpingcrab.com">FTP</a></h2>
				<p>
					FTP will only provide access to your home directory. FTP requires an FTP client (one may be included in your browser) and an account on the local Ubuntu system (to request an account, <a href="mailto: alexander3223098@gmail.com">email me</a>).
				</p>
				<p>
					In case this link doesn't work, just connect to <code>alexj.jumpingcrab.com</code> in your FTP client.
